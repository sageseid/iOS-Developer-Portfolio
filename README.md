### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS & Android Developer. Here's a bit of what I've worked on.

## Wificall
[`📲 Available on the App Store`](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wificall-ng/id1458874906?ls=1&mt=8)
[`📲 Available on the Play Store`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tizeti.wificall)


Wificall is a communication app that allows users to make voice calls using Wi-Fi or a stable internet connection. The app aims to provide a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional cellular calls by utilizing Wi-Fi networks to transmit voice and video data.I built both the android and IOS app for a telecommunications company i work for. Wificall was built by integrating the SIP protocol into the app's communication infrastructure. SIP allows the app to initiate, modify, and terminate voice calls over IP networks and provides the necessary signaling and session control capabilities to set up communication channels between users.

## [Steps](https://github.com/brittanyarima/Steps)
[`📲 Available on the App Store`](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1663569893)

Steps is a step counting app built with SwiftUI and utilizing HealthKit. This was a fun app to build! The home screen has a fun visual of how close the user is to their goal. The detail screen is built with a custom circle graph and a Swift Charts bar chart to show the user their weekly steps. The Awards tab encourages the user to keep taking steps to unlock awards each week. The Settings tab gives the user the option to change their daily steps goal and to enable or disable notifications. Check out more details in this repo at the link above!

## Chord Trainer
This is an app I built for a freelance client. This client wanted the core of an app that they could eventually expand on with their own design. Chord Trainer is a flashcard game that helps piano students practice chords. Students can choose their game settings on the home screen (adjust how fast the flash cards will change, as well as choose the duration of the game). Once the game begins, the piano chords will filter through in a random order and without repeating until the student has practiced all the chords. This was a fun app to build since I also play piano! It was also a nice challenge of working with Timers. Most of all, it was an incredible experience to get to work with a client and bring their idea to life!

## [Sketchy](https://github.com/brittanyarima/Sketchy)
An iPad sketch app built with PencilKit, SwiftUI, & UIKit. This project tested my ability to integrate UIKit with a SwiftUI project when needed. This project required UIKit compenents for the Canvas, as well as to give the user the ability to share their artwork. 
PencilKit is a powerhouse and central to this app, giving the user the ability to choose their drawing tools, colors, and the ability to erase and undo their changes. I also added toolbar items that give the user the ability to clear the whole canvas, undo, and share their drawing or save to their device.
